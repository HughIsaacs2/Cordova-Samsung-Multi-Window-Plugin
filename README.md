Samsung MultiWindow Plugin for Cordova
==============================

Cordova plugin to add tags to the AndroidManifest.xml that'll let your Cordova app run side-by-side other apps on Samsung devices.

That's all it does (I just needed something to streamline this process for me).

Sorry I have no plans to write drag and drop support or anything like that, you'll have to look elsewhere for extra features related to this.
